Verification procedure:

Unit tests:
    - Functions to be tested:
        - Tip speed calculation
        - RadiusMassElementMomentum
        - area
        - DragEstimation
        - size_power_subsystem
        - Class2Weight
        - PayloadRange
        - AircraftClimbPerf
        - RotorClimbPerf

    - Tip speed calculation:
        - Inputs: cruise speed
        - Outputs: maximum allowable cruise speed

        Tests:
        - Check that increasing airspeed leads to smaller tip velocity
        - Compare the results with hand calculations

    - RadiusMassElementMomentum
        - Inputs: take-off mass, n_rotors, n_blades, coaxial, V_tip
        - Outputs: radius, thrust, power, rotor mass

        Correlations:
        - Check for positive mass-thrust correlation
        - Check for positive mass-radius correlation
        - Check for positive mass-rotor mass correlation
        - Check for negative n_rotors-thrust correlation
        - Check for negative density-radius correlation
        - Check for positive gravity-thrust correlation

        Extreme value tests:
        - What happens when take-off mass = 0?
        - What happens when n_rotors/n_blades = 0?
        - What happens if the values are negative?

    - area_and_thrust
        - Inputs: cl, MTOM, dynamic pressure
        - Outputs: wing area, wingspan, chord AR

        Correlations
        - Negative cl-area
        - Positive MTOM-wing area
        - Negative dynamic pressure-wing area
        - Positive gravity-wing area

        Extreme value tests
        - 0 Cl leads to inf S
        - 0 MTOM = 0 S

        Hand calculation checks
        - Check wing area for a certain condition

    - DragEstimation
        - Inputs: wing area, cruise speed, viscosity at cruise, fuselage dimensions
        - Outputs: cd0

        Correlations
        - Positive fuselage size

    - size_power_subsystem
        - Inputs: rotor radius, take off thrust, cruise thrust, cruise time, take-off time, surface area
        - Outputs: battery mass, panel mass, power surplus
