## Setup
To get started with development:
1. Ensure that Python 3.11 installed.
2. Clone the GitHub repository by clicking on the green "Code" button above and follow the instructions.
3. Open the cloned folder in PyCharm (other IDEs can be used, adjust the following instructions accordingly).
4. Add a new interpreter in a [virtualenv environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). This ensures isolation so that the packages for this project do not conflict with your preinstalled ones.
5. Install all required packages by opening `requirements.txt` and clicking "Install requirements". This ensures that everyone uses the same package versions, preventing bugs that might be hard to find.
6. Read the code and Git guidelines in this document so the code stays consistent and clear.
